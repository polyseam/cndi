        Thanks for helping to improve our CNDI!
        If you are looking to request support for a new Template for the CNDI team to build, you're in the right spot!
        Keep in mind, Templates can be invoked using URLs, and using them does not require any changes made by the CNDI Team.

        That said, we do want to bring world class support to popular solutions and make them easy to deploy by adding them to our [Known Templates List](https://github.com/polyseam/cndi/blob/main/src/templates/knownTemplates.ts).

      description: |
        We have a number of Templates we aim to support found [here](https://github.com/orgs/polyseam/projects/6/views/7).
        If your target is on the list, please add an emoji reaction to the card to show your support!
