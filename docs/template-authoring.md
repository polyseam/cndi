# cndi template authoring üìù

CNDI Templates are YAML files with a few properties. Every Template is designed
to deploy a specific Application. CNDI ships with a few Templates including
[Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) and
[PostgreSQL](https://cloudnative-pg.io), they can be found in
[../templates](../templates/), but we can also create our own Templates, and
that's what this guide will focus on.

## structure

### prompts

The structure of a Template is broken into 3 main sections, the first and the
most unique fields among CNDIs contemporaries is `prompts`. The `prompts`
section is an array of objects, each object represents a question that the user
will be asked when they run `cndi create`. The `prompts` section is optional,
but it is recommended to include it as it will make your Template more
user-friendly.

Each prompt object has the following properties:

- `name` - a unique identifier for the prompt, and a handle to access the
  response in the rest of the Template
- `message` - the message displayed to the user when the prompt is shown
- `type` - the type of input expected from the user [defined below]()
- `default` - the default value for the prompt response
- `options` - an array of options for the user to choose from
- `condition` - a condition that must be met for the prompt to be shown
- `validators` - an array of validator names and options

The `type` field can be one of the following:

- `Input`
- `Secret`
- `Confirm`
- `Toggle`
- `Select`
- `List`
- `Checkbox`
- `Number`
- `File`

Let's look at an example prompts array.

We'll ask the user if they want to enable cert-manager, and if they do, we'll
ask for their email address.

```yaml
prompts:
- name: enable_cert_manager
  message: Do you want to enable cert-manager?
  type: Confirm
  default: true

- name: email
  message: Please enter your email address
  type: Input
  default: jane@example.com
  validators:
    - email
  condition:
    - "{{ $cndi.get_prompt_response(enable_cert_manager) }}"
    - ==
    - true
```

The result of this `prompts` array would be a prompt asking the user if they
want to use cert-manager.

```
? Would you like to enable cert-manager? (Y/n) ‚Ä∫
```

If the user presses `enter` they've selected `Y` by default and the next prompt
will be shown.

```
? Please enter your email address: (jane@example.com) ‚Ä∫
```

If the user instead submits `n`, the `email` prompt will be skipped.

One last thing to note before we move on is the
`"{{ $cndi.get_prompt_response(enable_cert_manager) }}"` line, which
demonstrates how we can access the response value of a prompt response by name.
This same syntax will be used to access the response value in the rest of the
Template.

### outputs

The `outputs` section is a map of output files which should be templated using
the response values from our `prompts`. The keys of the map are the 3 output
files that CNDI generates as the kernel of each CNDI project:

`readme` : The `README.md` file is the main documentation for your unique
project.

`env` : The `.env` file is a file that contains all the environment variables
and secrets that are needed to run your project.

`cndi_config` : The `cndi-config.yaml` file is the input file for the CNDI CLI.
It contains all the information needed to run your project, except for the
environment variables which can't be in source code.

To learn more about [readme](./project-structure.md),
[env](./project-structure.md), and [cndi_config](./project-structure.md), you
can check out the [CNDI Project Structure](./project-structure.md) section of
the docs.

### blocks

The `blocks` section is an array of objects, each object represents a block of
content. This content can be any fragment of YAML.

For an example of `blocks` let's look at how the `airflow` Template uses
`blocks` to define the `airflow-git-credentials` Secret.

```yaml
prompts:
- name: airflow_share_credentials
  message: Do you want to use your cluster credentials to fetch DAGs?
  type: Confirm
  default: false

blocks:
  - name: git_sync_dedicated
    content:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: airflow-git-credentials
        namespace: airflow
      stringData:
        GIT_SYNC_USERNAME: $cndi_on_ow.seal_secret_from_env_var(GIT_SYNC_USERNAME)
        GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD: $cndi_on_ow.seal_secret_from_env_var(GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD)

  - name: git_sync_shared
    content:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: airflow-git-credentials
        namespace: airflow
      stringData:
        GIT_SYNC_USERNAME: $cndi_on_ow.seal_secret_from_env_var(GIT_USERNAME)
        GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD: $cndi_on_ow.seal_secret_from_env_var(GIT_TOKEN)
outputs:
  cndi_config:
      cluster_manifests:
          $cndi.comment(airflow-git-sync-secret): Airflow Credentials
          git-sync-credentials-secret:
          $cndi.get_block(git_sync_dedicated):
              condition:
              - "{{ $cndi.get_prompt_response(airflow_share_credentials) }}"
              - ==
              - false
          $cndi.get_block(git_sync_shared):
              condition:
              - "{{ $cndi.get_prompt_response(airflow_share_credentials) }}"
              - ==
              - true
```

In this example, we have two blocks, `git_sync_dedicated` and `git_sync_shared`,
and depending on the value of the `airflow_share_credentials` prompt, we will
use one of the blocks in the `cndi_config` section.

The key takeaway here is that blocks allow us to define reusable fragments of
YAML which can be conditionally inserted based on `prompt` responses.

## summary

This document has covered the structure of a CNDI Template, including `prompts`,
`outputs`, and `blocks`. Armed with this knowledge, you should be able to create
your own CNDI Templates and deploy them using the CNDI CLI.
