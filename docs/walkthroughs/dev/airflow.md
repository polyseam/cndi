# dev/airflow walkthrough

A guide for using CNDI to deploy a GitOps enabled Airflow cluster on Kubernetes
in Local DEV enviroment

## overview 🔭

This walkthough uses `cndi` to customize and deploy our `dev/airflow` Template.
In just a few minutes we will be able to deploy a new Kubernetes cluster to DEV
that has been optimally configured for Airflow, including GitOps with Secrets
management, right out-of-the-box. This framework will enable quick iteration of
infrastructure, applications and manifests in a GitHub workflow you are already
comfortable with.

## prerequisites ✅

**You will need the following things to get up and running with cndi
successfully:**

- **Multipass**: [Download Multipass](https://multipass.run/install) for
  Windows, Linux or Mac

- **A GitHub account**: cndi helps you manage the state of your infrastructure
  using a GitOps workflow, so you'll need a
  [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
  with a valid
  [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## download cndi ⬇️

Run the following command within your terminal to download and install cndi:

```shell
# this will download the correct binary for your OS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polyseam/cndi/main/install.sh | sh
```

## create your cndi repository 📂

CNDI is designed around a GitOps workflow, so all of your cluster configuration
and infrastructure will be stored as code within a git repo, let's create that
now!

```bash
gh repo create my-cndi-cluster --private --clone && cd my-cndi-cluster
```

## creating cluster config with cndi templates using the interactive cli 🛠️

Now that we have a repo, let's use `cndi` to generate all of our Infrastructure
as Code and Cluster Configuration:

```shell
cndi init --interactive
```

You will get an interactive prompt where you'll name your project, then one to
specify the CNDI template you want.

For this project select the `dev/airflow` Template.

```shell
? Pick a template
   dev/basic
   gcp/basic
   azure/basic
 ❯ dev/airflow
   azure/airflow
   gcp/airflow
```

Below is the list of all of the interactive prompt values that should be
supplied for this project:

- **Cndi Project Name**: _name of project_
- **Template**: _list of templates to choose from_

---

- **GitHub Username**: _a user's handle on GitHub._
- **GitHub Repository URL**: _the url for the GitHub repository that will hold
  all cluster configuration_
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: _the access token CNDI will use to access
  your repo for cluster creation and synchronization_

---

- **Git Username for Airflow DAG Storage**: _a user's handle on GitHub used to
  synchronize Airflow DAGs_
- **Git Password for Airflow DAG Storage**: _a personal access token used to
  synchronize Airflow DAGs_
- **Git Repo for Airflow DAG Storage**: _url for repo where your Airflow DAGs
  will be stored_

---

- **Username you want to use for airflow cnpg database:** _username you want to
  use for airflow database_
- **Password you want to use for airflow cnpg database:** _password you want to
  use for airflow database_
- **Name of the postgresql database you want to use for airflow cnpg database:**
  _name of the postgresql database you want to use for airflow cnpg database_

![DEV instances dashboard](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/cndi-init-interactive.png)

This process will generate a `cndi-config.json` file, and `cndi` directory at
the root of your repository containing all the necessary files for the
configuration. It will also store all the values in a file called `.env` at the
root of your repository.

The structure of the generated CNDI project will be as follows:

```shell
├── 📁 cndi
│   ├── 📁 cluster_manifests
│   │   ├── 📁 applications
│   │   │   └── airflow.application.json
│   │   ├── argo-ingress.json
│   │   ├── cert-manager-cluster-issuer.json
│   │   └── git-credentials-secret.json
│   └── 📁 terraform
│       ├── airflow-dev-node.cndi-node.tf.json
│       └── etc 
├── cndi-config.jsonc
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── .github
└── README.md
```

For a breakdown of all of these files, checkout the
[outputs](/README.md#outputs-📂) section of the repo's main README.

---

## deploy your templated cluster configration 🚀

Once all the config is created and environment variables are uploaded to GitHub,
add, commit and push the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git status # take a quick look and make sure these are all files you want to push
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push --set-upstream origin main
cndi run
```

Two actions will take place

1. You should now see the cluster configuration has been uploaded to GitHub:
   ![GitHub repo](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/github-repo.png)

2. The terminal will show the clsuter being created and it will also output the
   instructions on how to access the argocd ui
   ![terraform outputs](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/terraform-outputs.png)

## Access the Argocd UI 🌐

Now, you need to set up port forwarding to access the argocd and airflow web
server from your local machine. Open a new terminal on your local machine (not
within the Multipass instance) and run the following command to display the IP
address of the dev Multipass instance.

```
multipass exec ${node.name} -- ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $7}' | tr -d '\\n'
```

In the terminal on your local machine, run the port forward command using the IP
address obtained from the previous step:

```
multipass exec ${node.name} -- sudo microk8s kubectl port-forward
svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443 --address <ip address of node>
```

Using the web browser on your local machine, now access Argocd by navigating to
http://<ip address of node>:8080

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

![.env file](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/argocd-admin-password.png)

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/argocd-ui-1.png)

Notice once inside the Argocd UI that the `cluster_manifests` in the GitHub
repository matches config in the ArgoCD UI

```shell
└── 📁 cndi
   └── 📁 cluster_manifests
       ├── 📁 applications
       │   └── airflow.application.json
       └────── git-credentials-secret.json
```

Verify all applications and manifests in the GitHub repository are present and
their status is healthy in the ArgoCD UI

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/argocd-ui-2.png)

## verify that Airflow app is healthy 🧐

To do this, the user can simply go to the go to the argocd UI and check Airflow
status or they can can try to port forward the Airflow webserver and see if they
can see Airflow's login page. The command to port forward the airflow ui is:

```
multipass exec ${node.name} -- sudo microk8s kubectl port-forward
svc/airflow-webserver -n airflow 8081:8080 --address <ip address of node>
```

Using the web browser on your local machine, now access Airflow by navigating to
http://<ip address of node>:8081

The default username is `admin` and the password is `admin`. If the page is
accessible, then the user can log in and begin using Airflow. If not, the user
wait, should go back and make sure the previous steps were was done correctly.

![Airflow UI](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/airflow-ui-0.png)

## verify Airflow is connected to the private DAG repository 🧐

Verify that Airflow is connected to the private DAG repository. If correct, the
private DAGs should be visible on the Airflow UI. If not,you should go back and
make sure that the private DAG repository is properly connected to Airflow with
the correct credentials:

![Airflow UI](/docs/walkthroughs/dev/img/airflow-ui-1.png)

## and you are done! ⚡️

You now have a fully-configured single node Kubernetes cluster with Airflow and
Argocd

## destroying resources in the cluster! 💣

**If you just want to take down any of your individual applications:**

- Delete that application or manifest from your `cndi-config.jsonc`
- Run `cndi ow`
- Commit changes
- Push your code changes to the repository

**If you want to take down the entire cluster run:**

```bash
cndi destroy
```
