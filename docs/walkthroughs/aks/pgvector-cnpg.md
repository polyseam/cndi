# Deploying PostgreSQL Vector Database on AKS using CNDI

## overview üî≠

In the realm of modern applications, the need for efficient and scalable
databases that can handle complex data types such as vectors is increasing.
PostgreSQL, with its extensive range of modules and extensions, has become a
go-to solution for such needs. One notable extension is pgvector, which enables
storing and querying vectors within PostgreSQL tables. This tutorial walks you
through deploying a GitOps-enabled PostgreSQL vector database cluster on Azure
Kubernetes Service (AKS) using CNDI.

## objectives

In this tutorial, you will:

1. **Install CNDI**: Learn how to install the CNDI tool to manage your
   cloud-native deployments.
2. **Deploy a PostgreSQL Vector Database Cluster on an AKS Cluster**: Set up a
   scalable and secure PostgreSQL vector database on Azure Kubernetes Service
   (AKS).
3. **Deploy a Jupyter Notebook on the AKS Cluster**: Launch a Jupyter Notebook
   instance on your AKS cluster for interactive data analysis.
4. **Upload Vectors into a PostgreSQL Database and Run Semantic Search
   Queries**: Use Jupyter Notebook to load data, create vectors, and perform
   semantic searches against your PostgreSQL database.

## prerequisites ‚úÖ

**You will need the following things to get up and running with CNDI
successfully:**

- **An Azure cloud account**: For deploying infrastructure within AKS.

- **Your cloud credentials**: ARM_CLIENT_SECRET, ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_TENANT_ID,
  ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID.

- **A domain name**: For accessing your cluster via a load balancer.
  [(Optional) if you dont have an domain name](docs/walkthroughs/aks/port-forwarding.md)

- **A GitHub account**: cndi helps you manage the state of your infrastructure
  using a GitOps workflow, so you'll need a
  [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
  with a valid
  [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

- **GitHub CLI**: You will need to have the GitHub CLI installed on your
  machine. You can download it [here](https://cli.github.com/).

Once the prompts are all answered the process will generate a `cndi_config.yaml`
file, and `cndi` directory at the root of your repository containing all the
necessary files for the configuration. It will also store all the values in a
file called `.env` at the root of your repository.

The structure of the generated CNDI project will be something like this:

```shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ cndi
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ cluster_manifests
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ applications
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cnpg.application.yaml

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Deploying the Cluster üöÄ

Once complete you should click on the link of the newly created repo cluster,
and scroll down to the readme for more information about your cnpg deployment

You should now see the cluster configuration has been uploaded to GitHub:

![GitHub repo](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/github-repo.png)

Now, open your web browser and navigate to your project on GitHub. Click on the
Actions tab, then click on the job that was triggered from your latest commit.

You will see something like the image below, which shows that GitHub has
successfully run the workflow.

![GitHub action](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/github-action.png)

It is common for `cndi run` to take a fair amount of time, as is the case with
most Terraform and cloud infrastructure deployments.

Once `cndi run` has been completed, at the end of the run will be a link to
`resource groups`, where you can view resources deployed by CNDI for this
project.

![current resource group](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/resource-groups.png)

---

## Accessing Your Services üåê

### Automatic DNS Setup with ExternalDNS

If you enabled ExternalDNS, your domain's DNS settings will be automatically
configured. Once the DNS changes propagate, you can access ArgoCD and PostgreSQL
using your domain names.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

<details >
<summary>
Manual DNS Setup (Optional)
</summary>
<div>
At the end of the cndi run there is also an output called `resource groups`,
which will have public loadbalancer.

- Copy the public IP of the load balancer.
- Create an A record in your domain registrar pointing to this IP.
- Open the domain names in your browser to access ArgoCD and PostgreSQL.

![cndi outputs](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/outputs.png)
![AKS LB](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/azure-nlb.png)

![google domains](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/google-domains-a-record.png)

If everything is working correctly you should now open the domain name you've
assigned for ArgoCD in your browser to see the ArgoCD login page. The DNS
changes may take a few minutes to propagate.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

<summary>
No DNS Setup - Port forwarding (Optional)
</summary>
<div>
This guide will walk you through the process of connecting to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using the Azure CLI and then port forwarding the service for local access.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  installed on your local machine.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed
  on your local machine.

## Steps

**1.Install Azure CLI:**

Install Azure CLI: If you haven't already, install the Azure CLI on your local
machine. You can download and install it from here.

**2.Login to Azure:**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to log in to
your Azure account:

```bash
az login
```

**2. Configure Kubernetes CLI (kubectl):**

If you haven't configured kubectl to use your Kubernetes cluster, you can do so
using the following command. Replace <subscription_id>, <resource-group-name>
and <cluster-name> with your cluster's details:

Set the cluster subscription

```bash
az account set --subscription <subscription_id>
```

Download cluster credentials

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <cluster-name>
```

## Port Forwarding the Services

To port forward the argocd web server to your local machine, use the kubectl
port-forward command. Replace <namespace> and <service-name> with the name of
the Argocd server service and <local-port> with the local port you want to use
(e.g., 8080):

```bash
## This is the format of the port fowarding command
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace> svc/<service-name> <local-port>:80
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n argocd svc/argocd-server 8080:80
```

**1. Access the Argocd Web UI:**

You will see a message similar to:

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
```

Let's open the port displayed in the browser:

eg: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

You should now see a login page for Argocd, and a place to enter a username and
password. The username is `admin` and the password is available in the `.env`
file we created for you under the key `ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/argocd-ui-0-port-foward.png)

**2. Terminating the Port Forwarding Session:**

To terminate the port forwarding session, simply press Ctrl+C in your terminal
when you're done using the Argocd web UI.

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

</div>

</details>
Once you are logged in verify all applications and manifests in the cluster are present and their status is healthy in the ArgoCD UI

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/argocd-ui-cnpg.png)

## Testing Your PostgreSQL Connection

Ensure CloudNativePG is properly accessible through your chosen domain after
deploying and configuring external access.

### Connect to the Database using PostgreSQL Command Line Tool

Install an PostgreSQL client like `psql` to access your database

Execute the command below, replacing placeholders with your postgresql host,
user and database name. You'll be prompted for the password.

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -p 5432 -U <username> -d <database>
```

This command `PSQL_CONNECTION_COMMAND` and the postgresql connection details can
be found in the .env file.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/psql-cli.png)

### Using PgAdmin

PgAdmin offers a GUI for managing your PostgreSQL databases. To connect:

**Launch PgAdmin** and navigate to the dashboard.

Enter the login and email credentials. The `PGADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD`, and
`PGADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL` can be found in the `.env` file. Through a connection
file, your database details are made automatically available, allowing you to
simply click on your server entry in PgAdmin's browser panel and enter your
postgres user admin password to connect to your database.

## Upload demo dataset and run search queries with Jupyter Notebook

In this section, you upload vectors into a PostgreSQL table and run semantic
search queries using SQL syntax.

In the following example, you use a dataset from a CSV file that contains a list
of books in different genres. Pgvector serves as a search engine, and the query
you run in your notebookserves as a client querying the PostgreSQL database.

### Login to Jupyter Notebook

Begin by logging into your Jupyter Notebook instance. Enter the login password.
The `JUPYTER_PASSWORD` can be found in the `.env` file. This is your development
environment where you will run the necessary commands and scripts.

![Login](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/notebook-login.png)

### Open JupyterHub

Navigate to JupyterHub to access your Jupyter environment.

![Open JupyterHub](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/notebook-open-jupyter.png)

### Load the Dataset and notebook file from URL

Next, open the URL in the console and copy this GitHub Repository URL containing
the dataset CSV file. This file includes the data that you will load into your
PostgreSQL database.

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Polyseam/cndi-examples-and-datasets/main/databases/postgres-pgvector/semantic-search/dataset.csv
```

![Open Console](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/jupyterhub-notebook-console-openurl.png)

![Dataset](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/dataset.png)

Again, open the URL in the console and copy this GitHub Repository URL
containing the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for processing the
dataset and performing the semantic search.

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Polyseam/cndi-examples-and-datasets/main/databases/postgres-pgvector/semantic-search/vector-database.ipynb
```

![Open Notebook](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/pre-notebook-run-one-host.png)
![Open Notebook](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/pre-notebook-run-two-host.png)

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

To run the entire notebook, click on Run in the menu, then select Run all cells.
This action will execute all the code cells in the notebook sequentially. The
notebook includes a query that performs a semantic search for the text "drama
about people and unhappy love" against the documents table in PostgreSQL

### Verify the Results

The output of the run is similar to the following:

_Title: Romeo and Juliet, Author: William Shakespeare, Paul Werstine (Editor),
Barbara A. Mowat (Editor), Paavo Emil Cajander (Translator) In Romeo and Juliet,
Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. In
part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were
about all young lovers._ --------_Title: A Midsummer Night's Dream, Author:
William Shakespeare, Paul Werstine (Editor), Barbara A. Mowat (Editor),
Catherine Belsey (Contributor) Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to
get complicated from the start.Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play
for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a
lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny._

![Run All Cells](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/post-notebook-run.png)

To ensure that the vectors were created correctly, you can use the pgAdmin tool
to verify the results.

![Query All Rows](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/pgadmin-query-all-rows.png)
![Embeddings](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/embeddings.png)

### and you are done! ‚ö°Ô∏è

By following these steps, you now have a fully-configured 3-node Kubernetes
cluster with a TLS-enabled PostgreSQL Vector Database Cluster. This setup allows
you to perform advanced semantic searches and ensures your data is stored
securely.

## modifying the cluster! üõ†Ô∏è

**To add another a node to the cluster:**

![cndi config](/docs/walkthroughs/aks/img/cndi-config.png)

- Go to the `cndi_config.yaml`
- In the `infrastructure.cndi.nodes` section, add a new cnpg node and save the
  file
- Run `cndi ow`
- `Add`, `commit` and `push` the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "add instance"
git push
```

## destroying resources in the cluster! üí£

**If you just want to take down any of your individual applications:**

- Delete that application or manifest from your `cndi_config.yaml`
- Run `cndi ow`
- `Add`, `commit` and `push` the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "destroy instance"
git push
```

## destroying ALL your resources! üí£

**If you want to take down the entire cluster and resources run:**

```bash
cndi destroy
```
