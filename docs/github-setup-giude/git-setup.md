### Step 2:  Create and save a GitHub access token for your new GitHub account


1. On (https://github.com/) click your profile picture in the top right corner and select ‘Settings’ from the menu
2. Click on ‘Developer settings’ (left column, near the bottom)
3. Click on ‘Personal access tokens’4. Click Continue and then click Done.
5. Click the blue hyperlink ‘Generate a personal access token’ and - if prompted - verify your account with your GitHub password
6. Enter a description for this token (i.e. CNDI access token)
7. Scroll down the scopes list until you find ‘admin:repo’ and check the box next to it. (This will check both the read and write boxes underneath)
8. Click ‘Generate token’ and save the token in a text file. (We recommend using the text editor that came with your operating system - ie. Notepad for Windows - and just saving it with the name ‘github-access-token’ in your Documents folder)
Important: Do not skip this step because you will need this key later to authenticate your Hop jobs and will not be able to simply return to the Settings to view it!
