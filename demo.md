# a demo that is very cool

This doc is going to walk through the "golden path" for CNDI. It uses the GitHub
CLI for creating GitHub Actions Secrets, but that isn't necessary.

1. Ensure you have the GitHub CLI
   [installed and configured](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/quickstart)

2. To download your executable run:

```bash
# if you are on windows you should run this in 'git bash'
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polyseam/cndi/main/install.sh | sh
```

3. Run `cndi create` and choose a template

4. Follow the prompts

5. Watch the magic 🪄
