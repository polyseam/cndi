# Deploying PostgreSQL with CloudNativePG on GKE using CNDI

## overview üî≠

This guide will walk you through deploying a GitOps-enabled PostgreSQL cluster
using CloudNativePG (CNPG) on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), with CNDI. This
setup includes GitOps for state management, TLS, and High Availability.

## prerequisites ‚úÖ

**You will need the following things to get up and running with CNDI
successfully:**

- **A GCP account and a GCP project**: cndi will deploy infrastructure into a
  [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) Project connected to a valid
  billing account.

- **Your GCP service account credentials**: cndi will leverage a Google Cloud
  Service Account using a **service-account-key.json**
  [credentials](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) file to
  deploy resources.

- **Domain Name**: For easy access to your cluster, attach a domain name to the
  load balancer. Provide this domain during the `cndi create` command, and CNDI
  will configure it automatically.

- **GitHub Account**: Manage your infrastructure's state using a GitOps
  workflow. Ensure you have a
  [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)
  and a
  [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  set up.

- **GitHub CLI**: Install the GitHub Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact
  with GitHub from your terminal. Download it from the
  [GitHub CLI page](https://cli.github.com/).

- [Here's a guide of how to set up your Google Cloud account including roles and permissions](/docs/cloud-setup/gcp/gcp-setup.md)

Once the prompts are all answered the process will generate a `cndi_config.yaml`
file, and `cndi` directory at the root of your repository containing all the
necessary files for the configuration. It will also store all the values in a
file called `.env` at the root of your repository.

The structure of the generated CNDI project will be something like this:

```shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ cndi
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ cluster_manifests
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ applications
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cnpg.application.yaml
|   |   |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pgadmin.application.yaml
|   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public_nginx.application.yaml
|   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ etc
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ argocd-ingress.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cert-manager-cluster-issuer.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ etc
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ terraform
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cdk.tf.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cndi_config.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Deploying the Cluster üöÄ

Once complete you should click on the link of the newly created repo cluster,
and scroll down to the readme for more information about your cnpg deployment

You should now see the cluster configuration has been uploaded to GitHub:

![GitHub repo](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/github-repo.png)

Now, open your web browser and navigate to your project on GitHub. Click on the
Actions tab, then click on the job that was triggered from your latest commit.

You will see something like the image below, which shows that GitHub has
successfully run the workflow.

![GitHub action](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/github-action.png)

It is common for `cndi run` to take a fair amount of time, as is the case with
most Terraform and cloud infrastructure deployments.

Once `cndi run` has been completed, at the end of the run will be a link to
`resource groups`, where you can view resources deployed by CNDI for this
project.

![current resource group](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/resource-groups.png)

## Accessing Your Services üåê

### Automatic DNS Setup with ExternalDNS

If you enabled ExternalDNS, your domain's DNS settings will be automatically
configured. Once the DNS changes propagate, you can access ArgoCD and PostgreSQL
using your domain names.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

<details >
<summary>
Manual DNS Setup (Optional)
</summary>
<div>

At the end of the cndi run there is also an output called `resource groups`,
which will have public loadbalancer. Copy the IP address(public host) of the
loadbalancer thats attached to your GKE instances.

![cndi outputs](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/outputs.png)

![gcp lb](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/gcp-nlb.png)

- Copy `public host`
- Go to your custom domain,
- Create an A record to route traffic to the load balancer IP address
  `public host` for Airflow and Argocd at the domain you provided.

![google domains](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/google-domains-a-record.png)

If everything is working correctly you should now open the domain name you've
assigned for ArgoCD in your browser to see the ArgoCD login page. The DNS
changes may take a few minutes to propagate.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/argocd-ui-0.png)

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

No DNS Setup - Port forwarding (Optional)
</summary>
<div>
This guide will walk you through the process of connecting to your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE),  cluster using the gcloud CLI and then port forwarding the service for local access.

## Prerequisites

- [Gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed on your
  local machine.
- The Kubernetes command-line tool
  [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) which
  allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.

## Steps

**1.Install and Configure `gcloud` CLI:**

If you haven't already, you'll need to install and configure the `gcloud` CLI.
You can download and set it up by following the instructions in the
[Google Cloud SDK documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

**2.Authenticate with Google Cloud:**

Use the `gcloud auth` command to authenticate with your Google Cloud account:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

**3.Configure Kubernetes CLI (kubectl):**

Set your Google Cloud project and the context for your Kubernetes cluster.
Replace <project_id> with your actual Google Cloud project ID , <region> with
the region the cluster is in and <cluster_name> with the name of your Kubernetes
cluster:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster_name> --region <region> --project <project_id>
```

## Port Forwarding the Services

To port forward the argocd web server to your local machine, use the kubectl
port-forward command. Replace <namespace> and <service-name> with the name of
the Argocd server service and <local-port> with the local port you want to use
(e.g., 8080):

```bash
## This is the format of the port fowarding command
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace> svc/<service-name> <local-port>:80
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n argocd svc/argocd-server 8080:80
```

**1. Access the Argocd Web UI:**

You will see a message similar to:

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
```

Let's open the port displayed in the browser:

eg: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

You should now see a login page for Argocd, and a place to enter a username and
password. The username is `admin` and the password is available in the `.env`
file we created for you under the key `ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/argocd-ui-0-port-foward.png)

**2. Terminating the Port Forwarding Session:**

To terminate the port forwarding session, simply press Ctrl+C in your terminal
when you're done using the Argocd web UI.

To log in, use the username `admin` and the password which is the value of the
`ARGOCD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the `.env` located in your CNDI project folder

</div>

</details>
Once you are logged in verify all applications and manifests in the cluster are present and their status is healthy in the ArgoCD UI

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/argocd-ui-cnpg.png)

## Testing Your PostgreSQL Connection

Ensure CloudNativePG is properly accessible through your chosen domain after
deploying and configuring external access.

### Connect to the Database Using PostgreSQL Command Line Tool

Install an PostgreSQL client like `psql` to access your database `

Execute the command below, replacing placeholders with your postgresql host,
user and database name. You'll be prompted for the password.

```bash
psql -h <hostname> -p 5432 -U <username> -d <database>
```

![Argocd UI](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/psql-cli.png)

This command `PSQL_CONNECTION_COMMAND` and the postgresql connection details can
be found in the .env file.

### Using PgAdmin (Optional)

PgAdmin offers a GUI for managing your PostgreSQL databases. To connect:

**Launch PgAdmin** and navigate to the dashboard.

Enter the login and email credentials. The `PGADMIN_LOGIN_PASSWORD`, and
`PGADMIN_LOGIN_EMAIL` can be found in the `.env` file. Through a connection
file, your database details are made automatically available, allowing you to
simply click on your server entry in PgAdmin's browser panel and enter your
postgres user admin password to connect to your database.

## and you are done! ‚ö°Ô∏è

You now have a fully-configured 3-node Kubernetes cluster with TLS-enabled
Postgresql Database Cluster

## modifying the cluster! üõ†Ô∏è

**To add another a node to the cluster:**

![cndi config](/docs/walkthroughs/gke/img/cndi-config.png)

- Go to the `cndi_config.yaml`
- In the `infrastructure.cndi.nodes` section, add a new cnpg node and save the
  file
- Run `cndi ow`
- `Add`, `commit` and `push` the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "add instance"
git push
```

## destroying resources in the cluster! üí£

**If you just want to take down any of your individual applications:**

- Delete that application or manifest from your `cndi_config.yaml`
- Run `cndi ow`
- `Add`, `commit` and `push` the config to your GitHub repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "destroy instance"
git push
```

**If you want to take down the entire cluster run:**

```bash
cndi destroy
```
