## dev

This deployment target is used to experiment and iterate on your cluster
locally.

## k3d locally

Your cluster will be deployed locally using [docker](https://hub.docker.com/),
so you will need to install that first. To spin up your cluster, push this repo
up to git, then run:

```bash
cndi run
```
