This project was created with [CNDI](https://github.com/polyseam/cndi), and this
README is to help show you the ropes.

## files and directories

### cndi/cluster_manifests

All files in the [cndi/cluster_manifests](/cndi/cluster_manifests) folder are
Kubernetes manifests. These are the files that will be applied to your
Kubernetes cluster when it is deployed and ready using ArgoCD.

### cndi/terraform

All files in the [cndi/terraform](/cndi/terraform) folder are
[Terraform](https://terraform.io) Resource files. These are the files that will
be used to provision your cloud infrastructure, as well as configure the virtual
machines to join your cluster as they come online.

### .github

The files within the [.github](/.github) folder are the workflows that run
within [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to call the
`cndi run` command when you push to the `"main"` branch.

### .env

The [.env](/.env) file is where you can set environment variables that will be
used by the `cndi` commands. These variables are used to configure the Terraform
resources and Kubernetes manifests. This file can contain secrets, because it
will not be committed to your repository. It comes pre-populated with a few
generated values, but there are a couple you must set yourself too. This file is
present in the [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file, so it will not be committed to
your repository.

### .gitignore

The [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file is where you can set files and directories
that you do not want to be committed to your repository. This file comes
pre-populated with a list of files that we know contain secret information.

## usage

Now that you've run `cndi init` and have a project, the next step is to set your
environment variables in the [.env](/.env) file. Once you've done that you can
use the GitHub CLI to set these variables as
[GitHub Actions Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets?tool=cli).

### secret setup

```bash
# this gh cli command sets .env variables as GitHub Actions Secrets

gh secret set -f .env
```

### push to GitHub, trigger `cndi run`

The next step is to just push your repo up to GitHub!

```bash
git add . 
git commit -m "initial commit" 
git push
```

Now that you have pushed to the `"main"` branch, the
[/.github/workflows/cndi-run.yaml](/.github/workflows/cndi-run.yaml) workflow
will run, and call the `cndi run` command. This will deploy your cluster to the
cloud, and then apply the Kubernetes manifests to it.

### updating your cluster

Now that you have a cluster, you can update it by:

1. modifying your [cndi_config.yaml](/cndi-config.yaml) file
2. running `cndi ow`
3. pushing all files to the `"main"` branch again

If you've modified your nodes, the infrastructure should be updated with
Terraform. If you've modified your Kubernetes manifests, the changes to the
manifests will be applied to the cluster.
