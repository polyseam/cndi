- Go to the Azure portal.
- Search for and select Virtual machines.
- Select the virtual machine from the list.
- Select Connect from the left menu.
- Select the option that fits with your preferred way of connecting.
- We recommend connecting to a VM over SSH using a public-private key pair, also
  known as SSH keys.

You can generate a new SSH key on your local machine. After you generate the
key, you can add the public key to your vm on enable authentication over SSH.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Enter a file location to save the key to (by default it will save to your users
directory)

When you are prompted to type a passphrase, press Enter Once you've successfully
created your private key will be saved in <your_chosen_directory>.ssh/id_rsa and
your public key will be saved in <your_chosen_directory>.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

- Choose `Reset SSH public key`
- Write `ubuntu` as the Username
- Copy the contents of the public key `id_rsa.pub` into SSH public key section
- Click update
- Now go to your local computer terminal

```
ssh -i <your_chosen_directory>.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@<ip_address_of_node>
```

You should now be connected to your instance

**note**: Azure currently supports SSH protocol 2 (SSH-2) RSA public-private key
pairs with a minimum length of 2048 bits. Other key formats such as ED25519 and
ECDSA are not supported.
